In REST Assured (a Java library for testing REST APIs), the keywords given, when, 
and then are part of a fluent interface that makes the code readable and structured like natural language. 
Here's a breakdown of each:
1)given(): sets up the preconditions for the API request.
	You define things like:
	
	Base URI / path

	Headers

	Parameters

	Authentication

	Request body (if needed)
2)when(): This defines the action, i.e., the actual HTTP method call (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)	
3)then(): This is used to verify the response. You assert status codes, response bodies, headers, etc.
